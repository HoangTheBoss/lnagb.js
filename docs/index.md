**Welcome to the lnagb.js project's homepage!**

**lnagb.js** is a JavaScript library created by [you-create][gh yc] to learn how
mathematical operations in Linear Algebra can be implemented using code. The
library is meant to be educational. You can take the library, play around with
it, learn something from it, but you probably should not use it in production
code that is going to serve some real clients. If you are learning Linear
Algebra, I suggest writing your own code, and you will be learning a lot.

On this website, you can:
- **[Browse the docs][docs]** to know how to use lnagb.js
- **[Learn Linear Algebra][learn]**, and also learn how to use lnagb.js along the way
- **[Try lnagb.js][lab]** in your browser console

The docs are generated from the docstrings placed along with the source code,
so expect the documentation to be something formal. Whereas if you choose to
learn Linear Algebra, you will start with the basic concepts of the subject
itself and get to use lnagb.js as a tool to help you check your work.

**lnagb.js is free software.** Its source code can be browsed [here][gh lnagbjs].
