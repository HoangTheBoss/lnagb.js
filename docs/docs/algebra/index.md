## Algebra
JavaScript code defined under this umbrella encodes mathematical concepts and
operations (including the ones that are not solely attributed to the subject
of Linear Algebra) that are not tied to matrices or vectors. However, they
may be used in several operations of matrices and/or vectors (linear
combination being an example).
