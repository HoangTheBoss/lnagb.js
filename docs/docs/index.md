## Docs

**Welcome to the lnagb.js documentation!**

The goal of the documentation is to provide (in great details) information on
how to use all of lnagb.js's functions, classes, and their methods. The pages
in this documentation are generated from the docstrings placed along with the
source code of lnagb.js itself using [`jsdoc2md`][gh jsdoc2md].

[gh jsdoc2md]: https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown
