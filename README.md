lnagb.js
========

This repository contains Linear Algebra operations implemented in JavaScript,
such as adding vectors, reducing matrices, matrix transformations, etc.

`lnagb.js` evolves as I ([@you_create][gh yc]) learn Linear Algebra. I hope one
day I will make a website out of this project. There was a similar project that
I worked on called [`pylnagb`][gh pylnagb], but I've decided to let it sit in
the corner of my garage (for now) because I'm currently not so used to using
Python.

`lnagb.js` is meant to be educational. I could have kept this script secret
in my computer with a bunch of GNU and FSF images, but I thought maybe making
it open-source would benefit others. But if this project ever helps anyone at
all, I'll be very surprised.
