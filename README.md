This repository contains Linear Algebra operations implemented in JavaScript,
such as adding vectors, reducing matrices, matrix transformations, etc. APIs are
named similarly to those of matrix classes in [three.js](https://threejs.org).

`lnagb.js` evolves as I ([@you-create][gh yc]) learn Linear Algebra. There was a
similar project that I worked on called [`pylnagb`][gh pylnagb], but I've
decided to let it sit in the corner of my garage (for now) because I'm currently
not so used to using Python.

`lnagb.js` is meant to be educational. I've learned a lot from coding it and I
will continue to work on it. If you are learning Linear Algebra, I suggest
writing the math in the form of code as well, and you will learn a lot too.
