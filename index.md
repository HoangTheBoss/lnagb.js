**Welcome to the lnagb.js project's home page!**

**lnagb.js** is a JavaScript library created by
[you-create](https://github.com/you-create/) to learn how mathematical
operations in Linear Algebra can be implemented using code. The library is meant
to be educational. You can take the library, play around with it, learn
something from it, but you probably should not use it in production code that is
going to serve some real clients. If you are learning Linear Algebra, I suggest
writing your own code, and you will be learning a lot.

On this website, you can:
- [**Browse the docs**](./docs/) to know how to use lnagb.js
- [**Learn Linear Algebra**](./learn/), and also learn how to use lnagb.js along the way
- [**Try lnagb.js**](./lab/) in your browser console

The docs are generated from the docstrings placed along with the source code,
so expect the documentation to be something formal. Whereas if you choose to
learn Linear Algebra, you will start with the basic concepts of the subject
itself and get to use lnagb.js as a tool to help you check your work.

**lnagb.js is free software.** Its source code can be browsed
[here](https://github.com/vecma-org/lnagb.js).

## Index

### [Docs](./docs/)

The **Docs**, or documentation, documents all of lnagb.js's classes, variables,
and methods in great details. It is divided into 3 areas according to the way
lnagb.js approaches Linear Algebra as a math subject:

- [**Algebra**][1], which covers fundamental and plain mathematical operations
  that are used in the operations needed by the other areas;
- [**Matrices**][2], which covers matrices as a distinct aspect of Linear
  Algebra and thus has everything related to them and their operations; and
- [**Vectors**][3], which are quanties somewhat similar to matrices but
  different enough to have their own dedicated space, which has everything
  related to them and their operations.

[2]: docs/matrices
[3]: docs/vectors

under that area, or visit the [Docs' main page](./docs/).

### [Learning Area](./learn/)

The **Learning Area** is a work in progress and will offer some exciting content
soon.

### [Lab](./lab/)

The **Lab** is where you can play with lnagb.js in your browser console.

### [Builds](./builds/)

The **Builds** section contains lnagb.js builds and a page that indexes those
builds.
